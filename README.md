# Vasco-Tweet

CI/CD integration robot that creates daily wordclouds from the tweets of the Brazilian football/soccer team "Vasco da Gama" also 
known as "Gigante da Colina" or "The Giant of the Hill" in english. The wordclouds are posted at: https://twitter.com/ResumoVasco

The project is build with the R language using mainly the CRAN packages rtweet and wordcloud2.

I've build this to learn some twitter integration with R, text mining/treatment and CI/CD basic actions.
